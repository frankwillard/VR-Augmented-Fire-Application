# Data augmented 360-degree video for WebXR

This is an example of 360° video playback with interactive data overlays created using the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/master/introduction/#what-is-a-frame) virtual reality framework and [D3](https://d3js.org/) JavaScript libraries for data visualization.

The experiment was conducted at the National Fire Research Laboratory (NFRL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The 360° camera used to record the video was housed in a transparent enclosure developed at NIST. For more information and additional 360° fire videos visit the [360-Degree Video in Fire Research](https://www.nist.gov/el/fire-research-division-73300/national-fire-research-laboratory-73306/360-degree-video-fire) project webpage.

The interactive hotspots (pink spheres) indicate locations where physical data (e.g. tempertures, heat flux, gas volume fraction) were measured during the experiment. The user can display data as a numerical value or in a time-value graph.
